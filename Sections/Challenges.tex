\section{Challenges}
%maks en side
- 
\subsection{Mechanical Challenges}
- Heating and deformation
- Mechanical linkages 
- Parts
- Small mechanical imperfection will give huge implications when rotating at high RPM.

\subsection{Vibrations}
\subsection{Flight Controller}

- More capable microcontroller-> timers, RAM, Processor, SPI for IMU(1MHz), 
- Challenge keeping constant rotational speed of motors--> Governor??
- 

\subsection{Time}

- To little time to build two flight controllers and test.
