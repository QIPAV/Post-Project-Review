\section{Guidance for Future Development}
 
 
 - In order to have enough time and achive the required stability--> start with a real flight controller like the pixhawk (EID)
 
 - In order to overcome the challenges of variable pitch, make your own controller from scratch to keep it simple. Take ideas, and implement them, but keep it simple. 
 
 - Brief summary of all key challenges in our project and how we solved it. 
 - Other challenges still not solved and our thoughts on how to solve them.
 
 - How we would continue. Where to find the most important information, and what knowledge topics needed to understand. Might even explain them as sub-chapters here?
